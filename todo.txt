# Game loop
# Load scenario
# Update (tick) all agents n times
# After n ticks repopulate, such that total number of agents equals m
# Repeat p iterations

# Scenarios
# Closer to the right wall -> higher chance of death (change wall over time)
# Death from overpopulation
# THE NEXUS (TM) - death if inside 8x8 box, higher chance of death away from THE NEXUS (TM)

# Inputs:
# 1-2   Distance from walls
# 3-7   Population density
# 8-11  Population density change
# 12    Distance to nearest
# 13-14 Direction to nearest

# Outputs:
# 1-2   Move left/right and up/down
